# Data Validation Summary for Statin Adverse Events Dashboard

## Objective

The primary objective of the data validation process was to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information presented on the "Statin Adverse Events Dashboard." This involved verifying that all visualizations, counts, and metrics displayed in Tableau directly and correctly reflect the underlying dataset (`ae_cleaned.csv`) that was processed from the OpenFDA FAERS API.

## Methodology

A systematic approach was taken to validate the dashboard:

1.  **Establishment of a Ground Truth Dataset:**
    *   The final cleaned dataset (`ae_cleaned.csv`), generated by the Python data acquisition and initial SQL cleaning scripts, was loaded into a PostgreSQL database. This dataset served as the single source of truth for validation.
    *   The dataset loaded into PostgreSQL contained **102,356 rows**, representing US adverse event reports for Atorvastatin, Simvastatin, and Rosuvastatin for the year 2020, after initial cleaning and filtering.

2.  **Independent Verification via SQL:**
    *   For each distinct component, chart on the Tableau dashboard, specific SQL queries were written and executed against the PostgreSQL database.
    *   These queries were designed to replicate the exact filtering, grouping, and aggregation logic applied in Tableau.

3.  **Direct Comparison:**
    *   The numerical results obtained from the SQL queries were directly compared against the values displayed on the corresponding elements within the Tableau dashboard.

## Key Areas Validated

The validation covered all primary components of the dashboard:

1.  **Overall Data Integrity:**
    *   **Total Row Count:** Confirmed that the total number of rows processed and loaded into PostgreSQL matched expectations for the defined scope (102,356 rows for the 2020 US statin data).
    *   **Date Range:** Verified that all records in `ae_cleaned.csv` fell within the specified receive date range (January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020).
    *   **API Query Spot Check:** An initial verification step involved selecting a random `report_id` from the downloaded data (`ae` table before final cleaning), querying it directly via the OpenFDA API, and ensuring key fields matched, confirming the raw data pull integrity for individual records (e.g., `report_id` 18619789).

2.  **Dashboard Visualizations & Metrics:**
    *   **Most Common Reported Issues:** Validated the counts for the top 15 most frequently reported `reaction` terms.
        *   *Example Finding:* "Fatigue" reported 1,735 times (matches Tableau).
    *   **Overall Trend (Line Chart):** Verified the `COUNT(Report ID)` for specific months.
        *   *Example Finding:* March 2020 showed 9,100 reports (matches Tableau).
    *   **Source Breakdown (Pie Chart/Bar Chart):** Confirmed the counts for each `qualification_description` (after joining with dimension tables).
        *   *Example Finding:* "Consumer or Non-Health Professional" category showed 56,787 reports (matches Tableau).
    *   **Serious vs. Not Serious (Pie Chart):** Validated the counts and percentages for reports classified as 'Serious' and 'Not Serious' (after joining with dimension tables).
        *   *Example Finding:* 'Serious' reports constituted 72.63% (matches Tableau).
    *   **Muscle-Related Events by Statin (Grouped Bar Chart):** For each of the three statins (Atorvastatin, Simvastatin, Rosuvastatin), validated the counts for each specific muscle-related `reaction` term included in the chart (using `generic_name LIKE '%DRUG_NAME%'` and filtering for the defined muscle terms).
        *   *Example Finding (Atorvastatin):* 'Muscle spasms' - 212 reports (matches Tableau).
        *   *Example Finding (Rosuvastatin):* 'Myalgia' - 165 reports (matches Tableau).
        *   *Example Finding (Simvastatin):* 'Myalgia' - 111 reports (matches Tableau).

## Discrepancy Observed

While analyzing adverse event reports related to statins, I found some unexpected results. In several cases, the main drug listed was not a statin. For example, Pantoprazole appeared as the primary suspect drug in some records. This happened because each adverse event report can include more than one drug. The API query collected all reports that mentioned a statin anywhere in the document, but the dataset also included every other drug listed in those reports. As a result, some records showed adverse reactions linked to drugs that were not statins, which affected the accuracy of my analysis. This was rectified later.



## Results

The validation process confirmed a **direct match** between the data displayed on the Tableau dashboard and the results obtained from independent SQL queries run against the source dataset in PostgreSQL for all tested components.


## Conclusion

This rigorous validation provides a high degree of confidence that the "Statin Adverse Events Dashboard" accurately represents the underlying FAERS data for the defined scope. The consistency between the dashboard visuals and direct SQL queries supports the reliability of the dashboard as an exploratory tool (within the acknowledged limitations of FAERS data itself).
